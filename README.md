# adventOfCode

This repository houses my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. I'm still very much learning, and am using these puzzles as an opportunity to practice new concepts and test-driven-development.

That being said, I don't expect anyone to need to read or maintain my code, so it's allowed to be ugly, clever, inelegant, and messy if needed.

Also this is fun, and whenever it stops being fun I'll do something else. I'm not obligated to finish.
